# Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: Bursting Electrical Activity

## Have a look at my project from Dynamical Systems class.

A burst consists of neuronal  spikes that helps facilitate communication between neurons.

For this project, I explored mathematical models used to model these electrical activities that goes on in the neurons of organisms.

# Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: Bursting Electrical Activity

## Have a look at my project from Dynamical Systems class.

 A burst consists of neuronal  spikes that helps facilitate communication between neurons. This project explores mathematical models used to model  electrical activities that goes on in the neurons of organisms. 
- Mainly the Hodgkin-Huxley Models of other variations of it.
- Also did simulations with the models and visualized results.

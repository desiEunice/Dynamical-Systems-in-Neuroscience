# Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: Bursting Electrical Activity

## Have a look at my project from Dynamical Systems class.

 A burst consists of neuronal  spikes that helps facilitate communication between neurons. This project explores mathematical models used to model  electrical activities that goes on in the neurons of organisms. 
- The famous Hodgkin-Huxley Models and other variations of it.
- Used [XPP/XPPAUT](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/whatis.html), software for solving differential equations, for simulations and visualizing results.
